# Introduction_to_Machine_Learning

This repo introduces principles, algorithms, and applications of machine learning from the point of view of modeling and prediction.

It includes formulation of learning problems and concepts of representation, over-fitting, and generalization.

These concepts are exercised in supervised learning.
